      <h2 id="health">Flat Faces & Health Issues</h2>
      <p>Pugs differentiate from other dog breeds through their wrinkled face, small bodies, and curly tails.</p>
      <p>Their small faces lead to health issues in normal respiratory. Because Pugs have a small face, they have a small nose; this leads to their nose being a common place for bacteria growth.</p>
      <p>The pug breed is also known for their small bodies. This breed has a large appettite and often leads to overweight problems including obesity.</p>
      <p>The small face leads to constant snoring and breathing problems.</p>
      <p>This noise is very common in pugs when eating, sleeping and even playing.</p>
